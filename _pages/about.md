I am a Research Scholar in Economics at [NYU Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/), a faculty in the Business Analytics group at the [University of Sydney Business School](https://www.sydney.edu.au/business/), and a Research Associate at the Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis ([CAMA](https://cama.crawford.anu.edu.au)) at the Australian National University. 

I hold a PhD in International Economics from the [Geneva Graduate Institute](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/). I have held positions at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).


My expertise is in statistical modeling, forecasting, econometrics, financial risk, global value chains, and international macroeconomics. 

My current research concentrates in: (1) Measuring the impact of risks, interdependence, exposure, and shock propagation in macroeconomic networks and global value chains; (2) Developing forecasting methods applied to financial data.

I have extensive teaching experience at graduate and undergraduate level to academic and business audiences. I cover subjects such as (business) statistics, financial data analysis, forecasting, predictive analytics, choice modeling, decision making with data, regression analysis, and econometrics. 

I have developed a strong background in navigating the intersection of theory and practice through my work with policy institutions such as the European Central Bank, the National Bank of Belgium, and the UN University Institute on Comparative Regional Integration Studies. 

I have applied my research in collaborations in with the industry such as KPMG and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. 

You can find me on [VoxEU](https://cepr.org/about/people/laurent-pauwels), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurentpauwels/), [Github](https://github.com/laurentpauwels), and [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=882788).
